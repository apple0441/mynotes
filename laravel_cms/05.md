## RESTFUL Routing and Controller

### RESTFUL Detailed Explanation

Resource controllers can simply create `RESTful` controllers related to resources. Next, we begin to demonstrate the operation of article resources.

Execute the following commands on the command line to build the controller:

```bash
php artisan controller:make ArticleController
```

Then we can register a resourceful route to the controller:

```php
Route::resource('article', 'ArticleController');
```

Open the `/app/controllers/` directory, we can see that the framework has automatically generated the `ArticleController.php` file for us, open it and take a look, we can roughly see the following structure:



```php
<?php

class ArticleController extends \BaseController {

/**
* Display a listing of the resource.
*
* @return Response
*/
public function index()
{
         //
}


/**
* Show the form for creating a new resource.
*
* @return Response
*/
public function create()
{
//
}


/**
* Store a newly created resource in storage.
*
* @return Response
*/
public function store()
{
         //
}


/**
* Display the specified resource.
*
* @param int $id
* @return Response
*/
public function show($id)
{
         //
}


/**
* Show the form for editing the specified resource.
*
* @param int $id
* @return Response
*/
public function edit($id)
{
//
}


/**
* Update the specified resource in storage.
*
* @param int $id
* @return Response
*/
public function update($id)
{
//
}


/**
* Remove the specified resource from storage.
*
* @param int $id
* @return Response
*/
public function destroy($id)
{
//
}

}

```

The framework automatically generated seven methods for me: `index`, `create`, `store`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, and `destroy`. So, what specific pages and operations do these 7 correspond to? Let’s take a look at the help manual on the official website.

Verb | Path | Action | Route Name
----- | ----- | ----- | ----
GET | /resource | index | resource.index
GET | /resource/create | create | resource.create
POST | /resource | store | resource.store
GET | /resource/{resource} | show | resource.show
GET | /resource/{resource}/edit | edit |resource.edit
PUT/PATCH | /resource/{resource} |update |resource.update
DELETE | /resource/{resource} | destroy | resource.destroy

Simply put:

`index` is used to display the resource list (page); `create` is used to display the new resource (page); `store` is used to accept the data from `POST` and store the new resource data to the database; `show` is used to display A resource (page) with a specific `id`; `edit` is used to display and edit a resource (page) with a specific `id`; `update` is used to accept data from `PUT` or `PATCH`, and update the data of a specific `id` resource to the database; `destroy` uses the `DELETE` method to actually delete a specific `id` resource from the database.

Ok, let's install the above methods in turn to write controllers and views.

### Resource pages and controllers

#### `index` method

`index` is used to display the resource list. Let’s set up this page template (located in `/apps/views/article/index.blade.php`) first. I won’t talk about the specific template writing and application. Here we will improve it` index` method (here we have not touched operations such as paging), and pass the data into the view.

```php
public function index()
{
$arts = Article::all();
return View::make('article.index')->with('arts',$arts);
}
```

Visit `http://{locdomain}/article` to display the page as shown below:

![article_index][1]

#### `create` method

The `create` method is used to display the page for creating a new resource. Let’s set this page template (located in `/apps/views/article/create.blade.php`) first, and improve the `create` method.

```php
public function create()
{
return View::make('article. create');
}
```

Visit `http://{locdomain}/article/create` to display the page as shown below:

![article_create][2]

#### `store` method

The `store` method is used to accept the data from `post`, verify the received data, and write it into the database after the verification is passed. Improve the `store` method, here we omit the data verification, and directly assume that it is legally stored in the database.

```php
     public function store()
{
$art = new Article;
$art->title = Input::get('title');
$art->content = Input::get('text_editor');
$art->slug = Input::get('slug');
$art->created_at = $art->updated_at = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
$art->save();
}
```

Store data using `Eloquent ORM`.

#### `show` method

The `show` method is used to display a resource with a specific `id`, there is nothing to say here, since the display of the article is mainly in the foreground, here we simply print out the variables.

```php
public function show($id)
{
$art = Article::find($id);
var_dump($art);
}
```

#### `edit` method

The `edit` method is used to modify the page of a specific `id` resource, we first set out this page template (located in `/apps/views/article/edit.blade.php`).

To put it briefly here, since the `edit` page needs to use the `PUT` or `PATCH` method to transmit the modification request data to the server, we need to modify the form, because some low-version browsers do not accept `PUT/PATCH/DELETE `The request method is not well supported, so Laravel itself provides a nice backward compatible solution:

> Still use the `POST` method, but provide a hidden field in the form with `name` as `_method` and `value` as `PUT` or `PATCH`, so that `Laravel` can handle `PUT/PATCH` well ` The incoming data.

Just use the following tags in your template form:

```php
{{ Form::open( array('url' => 'article/'.$art->id, 'method' => 'put') ) }}
 …
{{ Form::close() }}
```

or

```php
<form action="{{ url('article') }}" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PUT">
 …
</form>
```

Rhythm Let's improve the `edit` method:

```php
public function edit($id)
{
$art = Article::find($id);
return View::make('article.edit')->with('art', $art);
}
```

Visit `http://{locdomain}/article/2/edit` to display the page as shown below:

![article_edit][3]

The `edit` page needs to pass the original data `value` into the template.

#### `update` method

The `update` method accepts the data sent by `PUT` or `PATCH` on the `edit` page, and it should also verify the data. After the verification is passed, it will be written to the database. Here, we still omit the verification step, the `update` method code is as follows:

```php
     public function update($id)
{
//
$art = Article::find($id);
$art->title = Input::get('title');
$art->content = Input::get('text_editor');
$art->slug = Input::get('slug');
$art->updated_at = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
$art->save();
}
```

#### `destroy` method

The `destroy` method, uses the `DELETE` method to delete a specific `id` resource. Similar to the `PUT/PATCH` approach, Laravel also provides a backwards compatible solution.

> Still use the `POST` method, but provide a hidden field in the form with `name` as `_method` and `value` as `DELETE`, so that `Laravel` can delete specific resource data through `DELETE` .

Just use the following tags in your template form:

```php
{{ Form::open( array('url' => 'article/'.$art->id, 'method' => 'delete') ) }}
 …
{{ Form::close() }}
```

or

```php
<form action="{{ url('article') }}" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="DELETE">
 …
</form>
```

If we use `jQuery` to delete a specific resource, we can use its regular `POST Ajax` method. Here is the relevant demo `jQuery` code:

```php
$('.delete_item').click(function(){
var id = $(this).data('id');
$.ajax({
type: "POST",
url: "{{ url('article') }}" + '/' + id,
data: "_method=DELETE&_token={{{ csrf_token() }}}>",
success: function(msg){
if(msg == 1)
{
alert("Delete: Success");
}
else {
alert("Delete: Failed");
}
}
});
});
```

Notice the `data` line, we pass `_method=DELETE` and `_token={{{ csrf_token() }}}` two hidden field values through the regular `POST` method. The following `_token` is the token value to resist `CSRF` (cross-site request forgery).

Well, this is the end, in this section we have fully explained the routing and controller of `RESTFUL`. In the next section, we will start to pave the way for data verification and the display of front-end article pages.
